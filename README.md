# SIDIOUS.PIZZA

Vic's little corner of the internet

<a href="sidious.pizza"><img src="_includes/images/home-screen.png"></a>

## `cat what_is_this.md`

This is my personal website.

## `run`

This site is built with [Lume](https://lume.land/), a static site generator for Deno.

0. `brew install deno`

1. `git clone`
 
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sidiousvic/sidious.pizza.git
   cd sidious.pizza
```

2. `deno task serve`

This will start a local server at port `3000` with live reloading.

3. `deno task build`

This will generate the static website files in the `_site` directory.

## `echo $DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY`

I'm making this with a focus on experience, with a nostalgic nod at the internet 90s of my young years. Don't expect to find beautiful code here, I'm a working man and I've got nothing to prove.

## `echo meta.txt --list --pretty`
