Tanizaki Jun’ichirō wrote In Praise of Shadows (陰翳礼讃) in 1933, at a time when Japan was turning quickly toward "the West’s bright lights". He saw beauty in what was being left behind. In the dim rooms, in the soft glow of lacquerware, in the soft light that filters in slowly through the blinds at dusk.

Lately I’ve been thinking about that more. Not just in regards to design, but in how we, primates, relate to each other. Humans are full of contradictions, and that’s what makes us interesting. When something or someone feels too consistent, too polished, we intuit it suspicious and artificial.

Like Tanizaki, I don’t think clarity is always the goal. Sometimes it’s the hesitations, the things left unsaid, that tell you the most. That’s the space Tanizaki was writing about. 

```
朧月
蛇の影に
見えたかな

We might all do well to live with some degree of uncertainty. The opposite seems boring to me.

Sometimes I catch myself trying to escape shadows, then I remind myself that I can let them with me.
