Networks break in unusual ways. Small local problems can spread across the whole graph. In graph theory, they call these high-tension connection points [centrality nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality). They're like the spinal cord in any nervous system. Sever it, and messages from the brain can't reach the body. The web behaves unpredictably. Feedback loops make the system unstable. And there's hidden connections where systems that seem separate fail together. 

Ever seen a spider web burn?
