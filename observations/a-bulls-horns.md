And pride is just so. When it senses truth and the truth is not what it wanted, it stiffens and charges like a bull. But a bull’s horns do not bend; they break.

A tree leans toward the sun. A river bends around stone. The body shifts its weight before the next blow in a fight. These movements are natural and necessary to continue. Pride should follow the same rule. When the moment passes, go back to reason.

The mistake isn’t in failing. It is refusing to adjust. That is not conviction; it is stubbornness pretending to be conviction. 

So when you see you were wrong, take the correction. Decide what you value more, the phantom of consistence or standing with what is true. 

A man who adjusts grows stronger. Pride is sharp and tough, but brittle.
