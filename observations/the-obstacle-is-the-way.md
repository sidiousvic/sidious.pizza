Shōdō (障道), or *the way of obstacles*, is a name for a lean, athletic philosophy about how a person ought to **stand in nature**. It is not a system, and it does not try to explain all. It comes from my own experience with despair, suffering, and paralysis. I observed that the stance toward difficulty seems to matter more than the events themselves.

In this way, a person ought to understand and move with nature. Nature has direction and momentum. Things wear down, new forms decay and reappear. We may call it entropy or chaos, or we can simply call it *change*. Relative to this movement of nature, a human life can hold still, can turn away, or can follow, which follows our *stance*, of which I have described three. Stances are not identities and they are not morality. We adopt all stances at different times, and all we ought to understand is where they lead us with respect to nature.

The core tenet of this philosophy is “the obstacle is the way,” or *障害こそが道だ*, which we can shorten to *Shōdō*. The first thing we ought to explore is nature herself.

## Nature

Nature means the total field of reality: matter, energy, time, and the patterns that arise from them. It includes physics, biology, weather, decay, growth, and the cycles that repeat at every scale, from cell division to seasons to the lives of human beings.

(It is also ridden with inconsistencies, loops, and self-reference, with systems that affect themselves and are incomplete; see Gödel. This is worth exploring later.)

Nature is not a moral category and not a social one. It is not defined by what a culture accepts or calls normal. It is the set of processes that exist whether anyone approves of them or not. Gravity, aging, attraction, fatigue, injury, memory, error, learning, and death are all expressions of nature in this sense.

This field has a general drift. Over time, energy spreads, structures wear down, and systems tend toward disorder unless work is done to hold or renew them. One may call this entropy, or time, or chaos, not in the sense of pure randomness, but as the steady pressure of change, the tendency of things to shift, scatter, and break apart unless they are actively reshaped.

Obstacles are treated as natural events inside this field of nature. A difficult choice, an unwanted feeling or emotion, a physical limitation, a failure, a loss, or a sudden demand for responsibility all count as obstacles. They are not flaws in an elegant design; they are the way nature presents herself to us.

> “No one can ever remain without action even for a moment; all beings are driven by their qualities born of nature.”

From this perspective, the question is not how to avoid obstacles, because that would mean avoiding nature itself. The question is how to stand in front of them. The three stances of stasis, apostasis, and obstasis describe how a person can place themselves inside this larger field of cycles, feedback, life, and physics. Movement is always relative to that field. One can move with it, remain inert in front of it, or try to move against it.

None of these stances are moral categories. They are descriptive positions relative to nature. A person moves through all three throughout a life. The purpose of Shōdō is not to prescribe a stance but to reveal which one is presently being held, and what its consequences are in the ongoing movement of nature.

## Stasis

Stasis is the stance of non-movement relative to the flow of nature.  
Stasis is also the refusal to explore the source of an obstacle. A person in stasis does not deny the obstacle, but they do not look into it either. They remain in the discomfort without examining whether the difficulty comes from the world or from themselves. It is a stillness of awareness, not only a stillness of action.

In stasis, a person holds their position while the world around them continues to change. Work continues, relationships continue, and days repeat with familiar shapes, but new facts and new conditions do not really reach the centre. The outer pattern stays in place while the background reality moves on without much adjustment.

It may look like staying in a role that no longer fits, keeping a way of speaking that no one believes anymore, or living by an old story about oneself that belonged to another time. Somewhere there is a quiet sense that something has shifted, but it seems easier to grip the known form than to find a new one.

Fear often supports this stance: fear of loss, of conflict, of finding out that earlier choices can no longer be defended. The person allows time and entropy to work on everything around them but tries to keep their own stance untouched.

In Shōdō, stasis is treated as indistinguishable from death. This does not mean that nothing happens. It means that the person does not answer what happens. Time moves, structures age, demands appear. The person remains fixed, and in that way life in them stops, even while the body goes on.

## Apostasis

Apostasis is the stance of turning away from the obstacle while remaining in motion.  
Apostasis is movement that avoids the obstacle altogether. Instead of naming the difficulty plainly, the person directs themselves toward distractions, vices, or comforting stories. They run from the obstacle by creating alternate paths around it. Apostasis includes self-deception: the steady effort to look anywhere except at what nature has placed directly in front of them.

In apostasis there is often a great deal of activity. A person may change jobs, partners, cities, opinions, or routines. From a distance it can look like growth or energy. Underneath, the movement is organised so that a certain hard contact with reality never has to occur.

A person in apostasis may sense that a relationship has ended in everything but name, but instead of accepting this and mourning it, they build distractions and justifications around it. Another may know that a way of living is no longer honest, but choose new hobbies, new appearances, and new noise rather than sit with that knowledge. Grief, desire, and fear can all be covered in this way, with clever language or borrowed ideas that sound strong or calm but keep the real thing off to the side.

Looked at against the field of nature, apostasis is movement that fights the evidence of time and entropy. Nature shows that something has changed, or broken down, or reached its limit. The person spends their strength to deny this and to steer away from the point where a different stance would be required.

In this framework, apostasis is described as indistinguishable from evil, not as a moral category but as a distortion of nature. Evil here is the stance of replacing the real obstacle with an invented one, bending the world into a more comfortable picture and pulling oneself deeper into illusion. It is life used to run against nature’s drift.

## Obstasis

Obstasis is the stance of facing the obstacle as natural and moving with the underlying drift of nature.

In obstasis, a person accepts that obstacles are part of how matter, energy, time, and life behave. A loss, a duty, a failure, or a painful fact is not treated as an intrusion from outside the world, but as the present shape of the world for that person. The question becomes how to respond inside that shape.

This stance begins with a clear look at the situation. The person allows themselves to name what has happened and how things stand, as plainly as they can, without softening it and without making it larger for effect. They acknowledge what time has already done—what has worn out, what has ended, what has appeared, and what now calls for an answer.

There is then a decision to move into the obstacle. The step does not have to be large. Obstasis is not a call to heroism but to alignment. Sometimes the movement is gentle: acknowledging the obstacle without yet resolving it, waiting with awareness, or simply letting oneself feel what is happening. Obstasis can mean holding still physically while refusing to lie to oneself internally. The movement is in honesty, not in force.

To remain in obstasis, a person makes use of steady supports. Regular practice, simple routines, clear limits, and time for rest and thought all help someone stay in contact with difficulty without either collapsing or fleeing. These supports are not an attempt to stop change. They are a way of working with the ongoing demands that time and chaos place on a life.

There is also an inner part. When avoidance stops, fear, anger, confusion, and longing tend to grow louder for a while. In obstasis, these are recognised as part of nature passing through a human being. They are not taken as commands, but they are not denied. The task is to carry them in a way that does not ruin one’s own life or the lives of others, and to let them inform what must change.

Finally, obstasis includes the ability to release what no longer fits. When a job, relationship, project, or identity has reached its natural end, the person allows it to go. They accept that time and entropy have done their work there, and they step into what comes next without trying to drag the old form along as a permanent monument.

Obstasis describes a stance, not a permanent condition. A person may enter it, leave it, fall out of it, or return to it many times. The stance is simply the way in which one aligns with nature’s current demand, whether that demand is action, patience, grief, or release.

In Shōdō, obstasis is the only stance that is fully alive. It is movement with nature—not surrender and not defiance, but a kind of cooperation with the direction in which things are already going. The person still feels pain and still makes mistakes, but these, too, belong inside the same field they are trying to answer honestly.

障道（しょうどう）は、「障害こそが道だ」という姿勢に名前をつけたものです。体系ではなく、すべてを説明しようともしません。絶望や麻痺を経験したとき、出来事そのものよりも、向き合い方のほうが結果を左右することに気づきました。

自然には向きと流れがあり、物は擦り減り、形は崩れ、また現れます。それを変化と呼ぶなら、人の生き方もその流れに対して、止まる・背ける・合わせるという三つの姿勢を取れます。これは道徳ではなく、立ち方の話です。

この考えの核は「障害こそが道だ」です。まず自然を見ます。

### 自然

自然とは物質、エネルギー、時間、その相互作用すべてです。重力や老い、疲労、学習、死までを含みます。この場には時間とエントロピーによる「崩れの流れ」があります。障害はその流れの中の出来事であり、外部のバグではありません。

> 「誰も片時も行為せずにはいられない。すべての存在は、生まれもつ性質に動かされている。」

避けるのではなく、どう立つかが問われます。立ち方は三つ。停滞（ステイシス）、回避（アポステイシス）、そして正面から進む姿勢（オブステイシス）。

### 停滞

流れに対して動かず、障害を覗き込まない姿勢。現実が変わっても、自分は固まったまま。恐れが支えとなり、答えないことで内側が死んでいく。

### 回避

動いているようで障害を避け続ける姿勢。仕事や街、人間関係を変えても、本当に直面すべき点から逸れるための動き。現実を別の都合のいい形に歪めるので、自然に逆らう歪みとして「悪」に近い。

### 正面から進む

障害を自然の現れと受け入れ、その形のまま応じる姿勢。まずありのままを名づけ、少しでも中へ進む。正直であることが動き。支えとなる習慣や休息を持ち、避けないことで湧く感情を抱えつつ、何を手放すかを選ぶ。

これは常態ではなく、その時の流れに合わせる立ち方です。自然と協働する唯一「生きた」姿勢であり、痛みや失敗も同じ場の中で扱う。
