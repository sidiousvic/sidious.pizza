Shōdō (障道), or the way of obstacles, is a name for a lean, athletic philosophy about how a person ought to **stand in nature**. It is not a system and it does not try to explain all. It comes from my own experience with despair, suffering and paralysis. I observed that the stance toward difficulty seems to matter more than the events themselves.

In this way, a person ought to understand and move with nature. Nature has direction and momentum. Things wear down, new forms decay and reappear. We may call it entropy or chaos, or we can simply call it _change_. Relative to this movement of nature, a human life can hold still, can turn away, or can follow, which follows our _stance_, of which I have described three. Stances more than identities and they are not morality. We adopt all stances at different times, and all we ought to understand is where they lead us with respect to nature.

The core tenet of this philosophy is "the obstacle is the way" or _障害こそが道だ_, which we can shorten to _Shōdō_, or "the way of obstacles". I will attempt to explain it in a lean way below. The first thing we ought to explore is nature herself.

## Nature

Nature means the total field of reality, matter, energy, time, and the patterns that arise from them. It includes physics, biology, weather, decay, growth, and the cycles that repeat at every scale, from cell division to seasons to the lives of human beings. 

<span class="lead">_It is also ridden with inconsistencies, loops and self-reference, with systems that affect themselves and are incomplete, see [Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems). This is worth exploring later._</span>

Nature is not a moral category and not a social one. It is not defined by what a culture accepts or calls normal. It is the set of processes that exist whether anyone approves of them or not. Gravity, aging, attraction, fatigue, injury, memory, error, learning, and death are all expressions of nature in this sense.

This field has a general drift. Over time, energy spreads, structures wear down, and systems tend toward disorder unless work is done to hold or renew them. One may call this entropy, or time, or chaos, not in the sense of pure randomness, but as the steady pressure of change, the tendency of things to shift, scatter, and break apart unless they are actively reshaped.

Obstacles are treated as natural events inside this field of nature. A difficult choice, an unwanted feeling or emotion, a physical limitation, a failure, a loss, or a sudden demand for responsibility all count as obstacles. They are not flaws in an apparent elegant design, but they are the mere way nature presents herself us.

> “No one can ever remain without action even for a moment; all beings are driven by their qualities born of nature.”

From this perspective, the question is not how to avoid obstacles, because that would mean avoiding nature itself. The question is how to stand in front of them. The three stances of stasis, apostasis, and obstasis describe how a person can place themselves inside this larger field of cycles, feedback, life, and physics. Movement is always relative to that field. One can move with it, remain inert in front of it, or try to move against it.

## Stasis

Stasis is the stance of non movement relative to the flow of nature.

In stasis, a person holds their position while the world around them continues to change. Work continues, relationships continue, and days repeat with familiar shapes, but new facts and new conditions do not really reach the centre. The outer pattern stays in place while the background reality moves on without much adjustment.

It may look like staying in a role that no longer fits, keeping a way of speaking that no one believes anymore, or living by an old story about oneself that belonged to another time. Somewhere there is a quiet sense that something has shifted, but it seems easier to grip the known form than to find a new one.

Fear often supports this stance. Fear of loss, of conflict, of finding out that earlier choices can no longer be defended. The person allows time and entropy to work on everything around them but tries to keep their own stance untouched.

In Shōdō, stasis is treated as indistinguishable from death. This does not mean that nothing happens. It means that the person does not answer what happens. Time moves, structures age, demands appear. The person remains fixed, and in that way life in them stops, even while the body goes on.

## Apostasis

Apostasis is the stance of turning away from truth while remaining in motion.

In apostasis there is often a great deal of activity. A person may change jobs, partners, cities, opinions, or routines. From a distance it can look like growth, or adventure, or energy. Underneath, the movement is organised so that a certain hard contact with reality never has to occur.

A person in apostasis may sense that a relationship has ended in everything but name, but instead of accepting this and mourning it, they build distractions and justifications around it. Another may know that a way of living is no longer honest, but choose new hobbies, new appearances, and new noise rather than sit with that knowledge. Grief, desire, and fear can all be covered in this way, with clever language or borrowed ideas that sound strong or calm but keep the real thing off to the side.

Looked at against the field of nature, apostasis is movement that fights the evidence of time and entropy. Nature shows that something has changed, or broken down, or reached its limit. The person spends their strength to deny this and to steer away from the point where a different stance would be required.

In this framework, apostasis is described as indistinguishable from evil. Here evil is not a costume or a dramatic role. It is the harm that comes from refusing what is real, bending reality to fit a preferred picture, and pulling others into that distortion. It is life used to run against the grain of nature.

## Obstasis

Obstasis is the stance of facing the obstacle as natural and moving with the underlying drift of nature.

In obstasis, a person accepts that obstacles are part of how matter, energy, time, and life behave. A loss, a duty, a failure, or a painful fact is not treated as an intrusion from outside the world, but as the present shape of the world for that person. The question becomes how to respond inside that shape.

This stance begins with a clear look at the situation. The person allows themselves to name what has happened and how things stand, as plainly as they can, without softening it and without making it larger for effect. They acknowledge what time has already done, what has worn out, what has ended, what has appeared, and what now calls for an answer.

There is then a decision to move into the obstacle. The step does not have to be large. It can be an honest conversation that has been delayed, a change in behaviour that matches what is now known, a quiet act of care, or a slow effort to repair something neglected. The important point is that the step goes toward the hard fact, not away from it.

To remain in obstasis, a person makes use of steady supports. Regular practice, simple routines, clear limits, and time for rest and thought all help someone stay in contact with difficulty without either collapsing or fleeing. These supports are not an attempt to stop change. They are a way of working with the ongoing demands that time and chaos place on a life.

There is also an inner part. When avoidance stops, fear, anger, confusion, and longing tend to grow louder for a while. In obstasis, these are recognised as part of nature passing through a human being. They are not taken as commands, but they are not denied. The task is to carry them in a way that does not ruin one’s own life or the lives of others, and to let them inform what must change.

Finally, obstasis includes the ability to release what no longer fits. When a job, relationship, project, or identity has reached its natural end, the person allows it to go. They accept that time and entropy have done their work there, and they step into what comes next without trying to drag the old form along as a permanent monument.

In Shōdō, obstasis is the only stance that is fully alive. It is movement with nature, not surrender and not defiance, but a kind of cooperation with the direction in which things are already going. The person still feels pain and still makes mistakes, but these, too, belong inside the same field they are trying to answer honestly.
