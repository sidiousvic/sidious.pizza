I lost the path without knowing when it happened, and that was when fear took hold. The mountain did not give way on any side, but it folded inward, drawn itself around me. A silence stirred that felt older than the trees themselves. Only the sense that I had stepped into a pause that did not want me.

There was a stone. It leaned slightly, covered in old moss, dark and out of place. As if someone had set it there long before memory began. When I drew near, a thin thread of smoke curled across its face and disappeared.

I cleared the moss. An inscription surfaced.

> #### 自然はその歩みを止めない　
> Nature does not halt

> #### 人が選べるのは構えだけだ　 
> Man only decides stance

> #### 障害こそが道である　
> The obstacle is the way

</span>

> #### 構逃 　Koutou
> #### The stance that moves away from the pulse.
> #### Thus stood Shuten-dōji, laughing where light could not reach.
> #### Whoever runs toward his own shadow learns to fear the trace behind it.

<span style="text-align: right">

> #### 構間 　Koukan
> #### The stance of the interval.
> #### Thus knelt Peter, tears falling where no ear could hear.
> #### Whoever holds the interval sees his deviation, and pain leans toward him.

</span>

> #### 構順 　Koujun
> #### The stance that follows the pulse.
> #### Thus walked Arjuna, his courage brief as the bloom before dawn.
> #### Whoever steps into it leaves no mark, moving only in the breath the world allows.

I rose unsure whether the silence had changed, or only my place in it. I did not turn back.

I went deeper into the forest, toward the darkness waiting between the trees.
