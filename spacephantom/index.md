## Hello, world!

I have a dear friend, [Beau](https://beaunus.com). We met at a Xmas dinner not long after I started a position as a programming teacher in an engineering school in Tokyo. We sat at opposite sides of a long table that sat dozens, and between bites of turkey and chugs o' beer he broke the ice with a question that to this day has stayed with me.

> "Hey Vic, what was your "Hello, World!" moment?"

For those unaquainted, _"Hello, world!"_ is a phrase programmers use to celebrate their the first few lines of code written in a new language.

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("こんにちは世界!"); // "Hello, world!" in Rust (and Japanese)!
}
```

The program is usually small enough that it's also a good test that the code is running properly, and all utilities in orbit are working as they should.

[Space Phantom](/spacephantom/game) was my hello world moment.
