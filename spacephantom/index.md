I have a dear friend, [Beau](https://beaunus.com). We met at a Xmas dinner not long after I started a position as a programming teacher in an engineering school in Tokyo. We sat with dozens at opposite sides of a long table, and between bites of turkey and chugs o' beer he broke the ice with a question that stays with me to the day.

> "Hey Vic, what was your "Hello, World!" moment?"

For those unfamiliar, _"Hello, world!"_ is a phrase programmers use to celebrate their the first few lines of code written in a new language.

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("こんにちは世界!");
}
```

The program is usually small enough that it's also a good test that the code is running properly, and all tools in orbit are working as they should.

But Beau wasn't asking about my programs, he was asking about me. _"What was the moment when you told yourself that programming was worth learning?"_

[Space Phantom](/spacephantom/game) was my _"Hello world!"_ moment.

## Shot in the dark

It started as a bedroom project. I don't remember why, but I thought it would be cool to learn how to make a game. I found some recipes in the web to make text adventure games. I downloaded Visual Studio and began dishing out my first lines of _C#_ code.

```csharp
using System;

class BurritoDispenser
```

It was fun, and also hard. Half the time I had no idea of the meaning the symbols and expressions I was dishing out.

I thought making something more visual would help, so I moved on to trying out a space shooter game in the style of [Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga), using Unity3D as a mechanics engine.

Cicadas rang and the Japanese summer went on. Bit by bit, I put the jigsaw together.
