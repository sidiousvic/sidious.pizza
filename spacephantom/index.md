_"Space Phantom"_ is a my maiden software project. It was built with C# and Unity3D by following a game development programming manual. It was heavily inspired by the arcade classic [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders).

One of its unique features is that the ship gyrates towards the direction of motion, adjusting the angle of shooting. Implementing this orbit transform and its functional limit (so that the ship did not over rotate) was **wicked fun** and what I consider my ["Hello World!"](/posts/your-hello-world-moment) moment.

I made the music using Logic Pro X drum machine and graphics w/ a pixel editor. I would love to create a manual for it in the style of old NES games sometime.

In the meantime, just know that after loading (the game is far from optimized) you should press <span class="tag border">ENTER</span> and <span class="tag border">↑</span> <span class="tag border">←</span> <span class="tag border">→</span> <span class="tag border">↓</span> to play.
