  When I was in university I used to watch <a href="https://youtu.be/NXl99f9r9eo?t=1969"><em>Adult Swim</em></a>, a late night series that broadcast weird animated shows for adults. I guess the idea was to "take a swim into a wicked world". 
  <br><br>
  When bored, I'll occasionally sit by the computer and make an unstudied piece of doomy instrumental music, a little like one of those swims. That's the idea behind this series. 
  <br><br>
  Short. Weird. Computery. Unplanned. Enjoy a little <em>swim</em>!
