They bolt the third frame together at dawn. Wiring hangs like veins exposed and the fuel pump clicks with a rhythm that sounds almost confident. The salt pan mirrors the sky, and for a moment everything feels level.

Xenom leans into the cockpit, thumb hovering over the ignition. The Mark III coughs once, then settles into a low, animal hum. No flames, no drama—just a promise that this time the machine intends to keep running.

Mig wires the map to the dash, makes a joke about trust and distance, and pockets the spare fuses. The crew watches the exhaust shimmer and agrees, silently, that this is the one they will ride into the desert without looking back.
