The Zandhir call themselves snake eaters because they never refuse a dare and never spit out grit. They roll west with engines patched by prayer and tape, and somehow stay ahead of every storm.

Xenom trades a coil of copper for a spot in their convoy. Nights are loud with stories and louder with tuning sessions; the Mark III gets a new fuel map in exchange for a bottle of mezcal.

When the dunes rise like waves, the Zandhir cut diagonals that shouldn’t work, but do. At the horizon, a thin band of mountains glows. Someone laughs and says that’s just another snake to swallow. They gun the throttles anyway.
