Humidity drags the cables low and moss eats at the relay housings. The jungle smells like wet copper and leaf mold. Every radio check returns a different voice, like the canopy is playing games with them.

Xenom and Mig climb the lattice, knocking spiders aside, tightening bolts that keep sliding loose under the sweat-slick metal. They whisper call signs into the night, chasing a clean channel that never quite lands.

A troop of monkeys watches from a fig tree, chattering back every time the tower crackles. The relay stutters, then finally locks on—one clear tone through the noise. They grin, knowing it will probably wander again in an hour, but for now the path is lit.
