Locals call the fault Tattsu’s spine, as if the earth is sleeping with its back just under the sand. The rope runs hot where it rubs the edge, humming like a live wire.

Xenom drops first, boots knocking shale, lamp catching the blue fissures that stripe the cavern walls. Each step downward swaps air for pressure; each curse echoes twice before dissolving.

At the bottom they find a chamber of stalactites dripping mineral light. Someone breathes the name again—Tattsu—and the echo returns softer, almost approving, as they map a path deeper along the glowing seam.
