## üß† Early Life and Education

I was born in **Chihuahua**, northern Mexico. I lived there until 2009, then moved to the **American Southwest**, where I studied **cinematography** and **business** at **New Mexico State University**. In 2013 I lived in **northern China** for a short time, and since 2016 I've lived in **Japan**, mostly in **Tokyo** since 2019.

## üõ† Work and Life

I've worked in warehouses, taught math, coached football, built software for the grid, and shoveled dirt. I don't see myself as having a career, I've just do things for fun, for good of myself and others, and to earn my bread.

Some of the jobs I've done:
- Buyer for industrial supplies
- Warehouse worker
- Gardener
- Special needs educator
- American football coach
- Computer science instructor
- Engineering lead for energy software at **Toyota**

I don't build much software anymore, but I still can. Right now I focus on people, systems, and making decisions. One day, I'd like to open a small bar.

## üìê Math and Engineering

I like math, especially the kind that explains how things work. I care about structure, logic, and questions that don't have easy answers. I'm interested in **computer science** more than software. I think about what machines can know, what patterns can be trusted, and what systems last.

## üéµ Music

I play **guitar** and make playlists that follow a mood or idea. I like all kinds of music if it feels honest. I treat a playlist like a set of decisions, not background noise.

## üé® Art and Aesthetics

I care about how things are put together.  
I like:
- Pueblo architecture
- Urban graffiti
- Pixel art and retro UI
- Worn-in objects
- Simple, functional design
- Well-curated playlists

I don't like clutter. I like things that have a reason to be the way they are.

## üí™ Fitness and Lifestyle

I **lift weights**, **box**, and walk long distances‚Äîoften **15 to 25 kilometers a day**.  
I like walking around the city, studying at cafes, listening to music, and journaling.  
I drink coffee, soy protein, craft beer, and whiskey.

## üß≠ Personal Philosophy

- Make it work, make it pretty, make it fast
- Strength and competence behind humility
- Perfect is the enemy of good
- Being normal is excellent ‚Äî be excellently normal
- Kindness is caring with courage. Being nice is just caring without courage
- Don't be afraid to stand out ‚Äî but don't stand out for the sake of it
- Laughter matters
- Our relationships with other people are the most important thing we have

> "In a mad world, only the mad are sane." ‚Äî Akira Kurosawa
