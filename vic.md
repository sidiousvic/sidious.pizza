### BORN AND RAISED IN THE DESERT

![A mountain in a desert city.](/assets/images/chihuahua.webp){ optimize width=800 fetchpriority="low" caption="Chihuahua, Chih. Mexico" }

I was born and raised in the state of Chihuahua, in the north of Mexico. It is a desert region where water and plants are scarce. _Xicuahua_ means "dry and sandy place". It's the [birthplace of the burrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito#:~:text=Burritos%20are%20a%20traditional%20food%20of%20Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20a%20city%20bordering%20El%20Paso%2C%20Texas%2C%20in%20the%20northern%20Mexican%20state%20of%20Chihuahua%2C%20where%20people%20buy%20them%20at%20restaurants%20and%20roadside%20stands.%20Northern%20Mexican%20border%20towns%20like%20Villa%20Ahumada%20have%20an%20established%20reputation%20for%20serving%20burritos.) and has beautiful sunsets every day.

People in Chihuahua are hardy and loud. We sound angry when we talk about simple things. We smash the table with our fist when we're happy. We're proud and rarely admit we are wrong outright, but we are loyal and work hard and complain little. We very hospitable to friends, but dead suspicious of strangers.

<!--### MISLED YOUTH-->
<!---->
<!--I was a bit of a goblin _(_<img loading="lazy" alt="A small Shiba Inu dog, looking sad, smoking a cigarette and with a bottle of Corona beer resting in front of it" src="/assets/images/goblin.webp" width=40 height=40 style="display: inline-block; margin: -0.5rem 0;" />_)_ when young, Instead of praising Jesus, I was playing Zelda, smoking at school and watching MTV at night. My heroes were fiends like [Jamie Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=452Oxqm4E3Y) and [Angus Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCjhgiVnYDs). I skipped school, hung out with the wrong gang, and was a generic pain in the a`$$`.-->

<!--My saying is _Just Do Sh\*t_, which means don't stay there waiting for something to happen, you go and seek it, push it, smoke it. I may not be the smartest cat, but I'm easily bored and boredom breeds adventure.-->
<!---->
<!--I have had many jobs, I've been a sweeper, video store clerk, gardener, dishwasher, graphic designer, videographer, teacher, and an engineer. I've lived in the desert and near the hutongs and between the green mountains, near industrial wastelands and in the dystopic urban jungle.-->
