My name is Victor René Molina Rodríguez. I live in [澁谷東京 <em>(Shibuya, Tokyo)</em>](https://goo.gl/maps/1YfuGi5HYgRpBjN7A), but was born and raised in [Chihuahua, Mexico](https://goo.gl/maps/Ja9LxnZ6kosdra586). I'm <span id="age">?</span> years old. My vices are pizza, booze, [axe](https://youtu.be/en7EKL1pX5w) and [burritos](https://youtu.be/YZRtE9I5w7k). I also do a bit of skateboarding, boxing, and programming.

## BORN AND RAISED IN THE DESERT

I was born and raised in the north of Mexico. It is a desert region where water and plants are scarce. _Xicuahua_ means "dry and sandy place". It's the [birthplace of the burrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito#:~:text=Burritos%20are%20a%20traditional%20food%20of%20Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20a%20city%20bordering%20El%20Paso%2C%20Texas%2C%20in%20the%20northern%20Mexican%20state%20of%20Chihuahua%2C%20where%20people%20buy%20them%20at%20restaurants%20and%20roadside%20stands.%20Northern%20Mexican%20border%20towns%20like%20Villa%20Ahumada%20have%20an%20established%20reputation%20for%20serving%20burritos.) and has beautiful sunsets every day.

Growing up here made me hard-headed and stubborn but also tenacious.
