I have a dear friend, [Beau](https://beaunus.com). We met at a Xmas dinner not long after I started a position as a programming teacher in an engineering school in Tokyo. We sat with dozens at opposite sides of a long table, and between bites of turkey and chugs o' beer he broke the ice with a very interesting question.

> "Hey Vic, what was your "Hello, World!" moment?"

I knew _"Hello, world!"_ was a phrase programmers use to celebrate their the first few lines of code written in a new language.

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("こんにちは世界!"); // "Hello, World!"
}
```

Beau wasn't asking about my programs, though. He wanted to know about the moment I said _"man, this sh\*t is for me!"_.

For me, it happened when I was making [Space Phantom](/spacephantom).

## Aliens on board

It began as a bedroom project.

A few years ago, I was living in the deep countryside of Japan. I was a wandering music and sports teacher elementary schools. Days were fun, but phisically heavy, and I had a lot of downtime between bursts of work. I was looking for meaningful things to do during those moments.

I dabbled in animation and music. That summer I wrote [Tattsu](/posts/tattsu) on a school piano at Oiwake Elementary. I drew [Xeno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu3iGtqeYD4) on a 4th grade clasroom blackboard. My worn out journal is still ridden with stories about space assassins that I'd cooked up through those years.

I had all of these wacky ideas trying to get out, but even though they stand on their own as fun little labs, I felt that they needed a backdrop, something to bring weave and give them meaning in context.

One night, an old vision came back from the dead to me. Video games!

The drawings, the music and the stories. It all made sense. So now though... how the _f\*ck_ do you go about and make a game?

## Shot in the dark

Cicadas rang in the Japanese summer. A programming book and a can of Asahi sat on my desk, next to my computer. On the screen, Visual Studio, and my maiden lines of _C#_ code.

```csharp
using System;

class BurritoDispenser // This is a dramatization
```

I'd never done this before. Symbols and expressions looked like black magic conjurations. For a while all I could do was follow instructions blindly (Funnily enough, that's precisely what programs do).

Bit by bit though, I put the jigsaw together.
