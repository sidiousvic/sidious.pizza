I have a dear friend, [Beau](https://beaunus.com). We met at a Xmas dinner not long after I started a position as a programming teacher in an engineering school in Tokyo. We sat with dozens at opposite sides of a long table, and between bites of turkey and chugs o' beer he broke the ice with a question that stays with me to the day.

> "Hey Vic, what was your "Hello, World!" moment?"

I knew _"Hello, world!"_ was a phrase programmers use to celebrate their the first few lines of code written in a new language.

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("こんにちは世界!"); // "Hello, World!"
}
```

It's also a way to test that a program is compiling properly. If you see it, nothing broke (that you know of anyway).

But Beau wasn't asking about my programs, he was asking about my experiences as a programmer. _What was the moment when you told yourself, "man, this shit is for me!"?_

When did I realize that programming was fun? For me, it happened when I was making [Space Phantom](/spacephantom).

## Shot in the dark

It began as a bedroom project. A few years ago, I was living in the deep countryside of Japan. I was a music and sports teacher at a special needs school. The work was fun, but heavy on the left side of the brain, and I had a lot of downtime between lessons. I was looking for shit to do during those moments. I dabbled in [animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu3iGtqeYD4) and music.

...

I downloaded Visual Studio and began dishing out my first lines of _C#_ code.

```csharp
using System;

class BurritoDispenser
```

Cicadas rang and the Japanese summer went on. Bit by bit, I put the jigsaw together.
