With the help of a Finnish friend and fellow mathematics enthusiast, I've derived an algebraic formula that might prove useful to those wanting to find out.

Let `Fa` be amount you fuck about, and `Fo` how much you do find out. We specify _a priori_ that a direct linear relationship exists between fucking about and finding out. This relationship can be in a simple linear equation, as follows.

```math

Fa = k(Fo)

```

```bash

Fa (Fucking about)

 9 ·         ✧ 9 = (0.6)15
   ·        /
   ·       /
 6 ·      /
   ·     /     k = 0.6
   ·    /
 3 ·   /
   ·  /
   · /
   + · · · · · · · · · · · · · > Fo (Finding out)
 0       9     18     ...

```

Therefore we have a way to solve for how much we need to fuck about in order to find out.

## A slight impediment

Unfortunately, you can't fuck about too much before [pining for the fjords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vuW6tQ0218). When the value of `Fa` exceeds a certain threshold, the amount of finding out collapses.

We must incorporate into the formula a limit to account for a scenario where excessive fucking about (denoted as `Fmax`) results in being _ded_.

The modified formula is as follows,

```math

Fo = \left\{~Fa<Fmax:Fa / k,~Fa>=Fmax:Infinity~\right\}

```

```bash

Fa (Fucking about)

 9 ·
   ·                             k = 0.6
 6 ·     ✧ 5.394 = 0.6(8.99)     Fmax = 9
   ·    /
 3 ·   /
   ·  /    Infinity
   · /    ↓
   + · · · · · · · · · · · · > Fo (Finding out)
 0       9     18    ...

```

This piecewise function demonstrates that while the fucking about generally leads to increased finding out, _there is a crucial limit beyond which it becomes counterproductive to fuck about_.

Let this be a useful means by which we can estimate the optimal amount of fucking about, provided we are able to establish the values for `k` and `Fmax` practical accuracy.
