![A spaceship](/assets/images/shot-dark.webp){ optimize width=800 }

Cicadas rang outside. The fan blew smoke of a marlboro joint into the haze of the Japanese summer. A programming manual and an empty can of Asahi sat on the desk, next to my computer. On the screen, Unity3D, and my maiden lines in _C#_.

I run the compiler. Launch the program. An ominous beat plays. The screen reads: `SPACE PHANTOM`. Hit <span class="tag border button">ENTER</span>. An alien ship emerges from the dark.

_Pew pew, swoosh swoosh._

Put the ciggy down, and lean back, hands over head. I look through the pane. A full moon hangs over the mountains. Sigh. There, I've done it. I've made a game.

A boring game.

Shit.

Well, what if if the spaceship shot at an angle? That would demand positioning and aim.

Hmm. Did you hear that?

_<p class="shake">An angle.</p>_

A tinge of fear drips down my spine. There's something sinister about the thought, something smells... funny.

_...something smells like `math`._

## Fear of the dark

Back then, as we have seen, I was fucking scared of math.

![A field littered by tall stalagmites, with staring demonic eyes floating in the sky](/assets/images/fear-of-the-dark.webp){ optimize width=800 }

I'm a primate. We tend to hate math. Some are born for it, yes, but most of us have a fear of the dark.

Fear of the dark is an [underrated Iron Maiden album](https://youtu.be/bePCRKGUwAY?si=SRtiL8vko69cZHvB).

It's also one of our primal instincts. At its core, it's a [survival optimization algorithm](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4364301/) to avoid dangers hard to detect without light. [Visible radiation supresses the amygdala](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0252350), the fear sentinel of the brain. It's a mechanism to tread with the unknown.

When you're in the dark, your brain drips with adrenaline. It summons shapes to the mind's eye, but tenuously lit, tricky to observe. They slither like a fog of wicked lizard eyes, monsters whose forms we cannot not fully see.

And that's where terror lies, in what we cannot fully see.

It's not in the object, but in the shadow.

The shark in Jaws. The xenomorph. Sauron. They all scared us, not because they were monsters, but _because they were shadows._

Math scared me because it dealt with shadows.

## In praise of shadows

A shadow is a `2D` projection of a `3D` object. A [sine wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave) is a `1D` projection of radial `2D` motion. Both have the property of hiding dimensions from view, partial instancing of objects that are otherwise out of sight.

Math is ridden with these ill-lit, abstract objects. Numbers, angles, quaternions, they're all shadows.

Ninety-something years ago, Tanizaki made a profound observation about shadows.

And toilets.
