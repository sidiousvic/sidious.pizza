![A spaceship](/assets/images/shot-dark.webp){ optimize width=800 }

Cicadas rang outside. The fan on full throttle, blowed smoke of a marlboro joint into the haze of the Japanese summer. A programming manual and an empty can of Asahi sat on the desk, next to my computer. On the screen, Microsoft Visual Studio, and my maiden lines of _C#_. I hit<span class="tag border venomous"> COMPILE</span>.

```csharp
Unhandled exception. System.NullReferenceException:
    Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
        at Program.Main() in C:\f*ck\you.cs:line 6
```

Okay, I need another drink.

Grab the house keys. Usual symbols do a demon dance inside my mind. `reference`. `instance`, `NULL`, it all sounds like fucking voodoo. Fit my shoes on, mumbling, `"NULL, my ass!"`. I immediately realize it's a self burn, but I don't care. I'm tired, Satan. This programming thing is harder than I tought. I mean, I wasn't expecting cake, but there's something _sinister_ about it. And I think I finally know what it is.

_It smells too much like math._

Primates tend to hate math. Yes, some are born for it, but most of us like touching things.

Maths is the _`OG`_ dark arts... It doesn't deal with the thing, it deals with the _shadow of the thing_. The fancy word for it is [_abstraction_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction).

> <dialogue ai> **AI:** Abstraction in mathematics is the process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns or properties of a mathematical concept or object, removing any dependence on real-world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.

I lock the door and tread outside. It's damp and dark. I feel lost, but at least I know the way to Family Mart.

## Raiders of the lost _Î¸_

The screen lights up like shining a torch to ancient hieroglyphs on a wall. They look as intractable as before, but you have no time to hesitate. The necrophagi lurk in the dark, and you can't stay for too long.

Programming's a bitch. But she's wicked fun.
