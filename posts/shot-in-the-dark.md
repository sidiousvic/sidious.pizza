![A spaceship](/assets/images/shot-dark.webp){ optimize width=800 }

Cicadas rang outside. The fan blew smoke of a marlboro joint into the haze of the Japanese summer. A programming manual and an empty can of Asahi sat on the desk, next to my computer. On the screen, Unity3D, and my maiden lines of _C#_.

```csharp
 float angle = Mathf.Atan2(player.y, player.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
 Quaternion theta = Quaternion.AngleAxis(angle, Vector3.forward);
```

I looked at the program. Hemingway would be proud. It was a good program, and it was a true program. The commands were simple. The logic was sound. It read like a fine conversation. Flowed like fine bourbon near the fireplace. Ebbed like the bamboo in a grove, casting quiet shadows under twilight.

I run the compiler. Start the game. An ominous beat plays. The screen reads: `SPACE PHANTOM`. Hit <span class="tag border">ENTER</span>. An alien ship emerges from the dark. I hit the arrow key, ready to play.

I play for a while, proud of what I've done, but there's just a small problem. The game's not that fun. There's no way around it, it doesn't feel dynamic enough. Maybe, if I only could shoot at an angle.

_An angle._

There's was something _sinister_ about this idea. Something smelt... funny about it.

_...It smelled like `math`._

A Kafkian tinge of fear drips down my spine. So this is it. I've ensared myself in my own web. _I am not the fly. I am the spider_.

I run for the door and tread outside. It's dark, damp and I'm scared, but at least I know the way to FamilyMart.

## Fear of the dark

Primates tend to hate math. Some are born for kkit, but most of us have a fear of the dark.

Might be fear of the unknown. [Light supresses the amygdala](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8208532/).

## The dark arts

![A mathematical book sitting in a dark dungeon, lit by candlelight](/assets/images/dark-arts-math.webp){ optimize width=800 }

Math is the _`OG`_ dark arts; it doesn't deal with the thing, it deals with the _shadows of the thing_. The objects are abstract [abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction), non-physical. Angles, matrices, quaternions are spectres.

No amount of grammar, though, will drive abstract from the darkness. No amount of syntax will let us touch them, hear them, or see them, at least not in their primal form.

It's called abstract thinking. The same word represents different objects.

Computer programs are built in this way too, so as with mathematical expressions, they are like sigils of the occult. Weaving programs is like summoning demons, it asks us to reach into the shadows.

## In praise of shadows

The old Japanese architects learned to live in darkness, to welcome the darkness and shadows.

Tanizaki talks about dark toilets.

Pirates wore eye patches to see in the darkness.

We face the unknown by speaking the word. Say the word and you'll be free. Tell a story.

When I was a little kid I used stories in my head.

Time is ripe for another one.

## Raiders of the lost _Î¸_

![A torch illuminarting ancient symbols on a dungeon wall.](/assets/images/indy-torch.webp){ optimize width=700 }

The screen lights up like shining a torch to ancient hieroglyphs on a wall.

They look as intractable as before, but you have no time to hesitate. I have a Strong Zero.

I think of Tanizaki, and instead of staring, I close my eyes and submerge myself.

I can see the spectres of the symbols in my inner eye. Suddenly it all makes sense.

The angle is theta.

```csharp
 float angle = Mathf.Atan2(player.y, player.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
 Quaternion theta = Quaternion.AngleAxis(angle, Vector3.forward);
```
