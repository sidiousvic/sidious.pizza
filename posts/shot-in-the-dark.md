It began as a bedroom project.

Frogs croaked outside. The fan ran on high, blowing smoke of a marlboro joint into the haze of the Japanese summer. A programming manual and a can of Asahi sat on the desk, next to my computer. On the screen, Microsoft Visual Studio, and my maiden lines of _C#_.

Press <span class="tag border">play</span> .

```csharp
Unhandled exception. System.NullReferenceException:
    Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

```

Okay. _I need another drink._

I'm shining a torch to these hierogplyphs, trying to decipher what's wrong. `reference`, `exception`, `null`, `instance`, `bloober`, `huyhuy`, `plumbus`, it all sounds like fucking voodoo. What the hell you mean an object is not an object? I beg to differ. It's damp and dark in my mind.

Head to the corner store to distract myself. Getting pretty sick of feeling lost. At least I know the way to _Family Mart_.

Grab another can from the conbini fridge.

## Aliens on board

I'd lived in rural Japan for a while, teaching music and sports at elementary schools in the deep countryside. Days were fun inside the halls, but quiet after work. I had a girlfriend, but she lived hours away. I didn't have much money.

I was riding solo through the void of space.

When we are stranded in the physical world, we go to our mind to find adventures. We travel to worlds in films and music and books and experience life there. When that's not enough, we sometimes begin cooking up our own.

That spring, I wrote [Tattsu](/posts/tattsu) on a school piano at Oiwake Elementary. I drew [Xeno the Alien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu3iGtqeYD4) on a 4th grade clasroom blackboard. My journal was ridden with scenes about undead bounty hunters and space assassins. It was fun, and it help me find a quantum of solace in that solitary time.

Every world that burst out was like a small planet.

I shared them with my friends and students and other fellow primates. It was fun and rewarding to see their reactions.

I still felt like something was missing.
