### Axioms

- Programming is a mix of maths and language.
- Maths and language deal with shadows.
- Primates have a fear of the dark.
- We can praise shadows instead of driving them away.
- I've been trying to understand the symbols in the light.
- Extinguish the torch. Observe the inner eye.
- The answer lies between the shadows and the light.

Cicadas rang outside. The fan on full throttle, blowed smoke of a marlboro joint into the haze of the Japanese summer. A programming manual and an empty can of Asahi sat on the desk, next to my computer. On the screen, Unity3D, and my maiden lines of _C#_.

```csharp
    float angle = Mathf.Atan2(player.y, player.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
    Quaternion theta = Quaternion.AngleAxis(angle, Vector3.forward);
```

I do the ritual. Run the compiler. Start the game. An ominous beat plays. The screen reads: `SPACE PHANTOM`. Hit <span class="tag border">ENTER</span>. An alien ship emerges from the dark. I hit the arrow key. The screen freezes up immediately.

This programming thing's a bitch. I haven't moved much, but I'm tired like a dog. Brain juice drips out with every bug. I mean, I wasn't expecting cake. But there's something _sinister_ about it.

_It smells too much like `MATH`._

Primates tend to hate math. Some are born for it, but most of us have a fear of the dark.

Math is the _`OG`_ dark arts. It doesn't deal with the thing, it deals with the _shadows of the thing_. It describes non-physical objects, objects in the void. We ooze these objects into partial view with symbols, and organize these symbols into formal language. No amount of grammars, though, will drive them from the dark.

I grab my keys, fit my shoes on, lock the door. I'm also afraid of the dark, but at least I know the way to Family Mart.

## In praise of shadows

> No words can describe that sensation as one sits in the dim light, basking in the faint glow reflected from the shoji.

<!-- The screen lights up like shining a torch to ancient hieroglyphs on a wall. They look as intractable as before, but you have no time to hesitate. The necrophagi lurk in the dark, and you can't stay for too long. -->
