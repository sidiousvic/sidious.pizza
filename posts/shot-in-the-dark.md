### Shot in the dark

- Struggle to learn programming.
- Remind of the planets.

### Aliens on board

- Teaching in Japan. Solitude. Desire to stop teaching, be creator one day. Hard to cook shit up.

- Teach the plantes, they are not sticking. Tell a story of spaceships to students. They are psyched.

- Begin using stories to create. Xeno. Tattsu. NEMESIS. Shit's flowing.

###

- Go back from Famima. Tell myself I'm Indy Jones exploring a cave.

- Get the game done. It's just a clone of Space Invaders.

- Show to students. One motherfucker. Why can't it spin. It's not supposed to.

- Who the fuck said it's not supposed to? Raiders of the lost theta.

### Raiders of the lost θ

- This time is wicked treats. Learn some math. Get the feature done.

- Programming's a bitch, but she's fucking fun.

It was just another bedroom project.

Cicadas rang outside. The fan ran on high, blowing smoke of a marlboro joint into the haze of the Japanese summer. A programming manual and a can of Asahi sat on the desk, next to my computer. On the screen, Microsoft Visual Studio, and my maiden lines of _C#_.

<span class="tag border">COMPILE</span>.

```csharp
Unhandled exception. System.NullReferenceException:
    Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
        at Program.Main() in C:\f*ck\you.cs:line 6
```

Okay, I need another drink.

I grab my keys from the table. The usual sigils do the demon dance in my mind. `exception`. `instance`, `null`, it all sounds like fucking voodoo. Fit my shoes on, mumbling. _"What the hell you mean `object is not an object`?"_ Been stuck here for hours. I'm tired, Satan.

I lock the door and tread into the night. It's damp and dark outside and I feel lost, but at least I know the way to Family Mart.

## Aliens on board

![A japanese classroom with an alien drawn on the blackboard](/assets/images/aliens-on-board.webp){ optimize priority="high" width=800 }

I'd lived in rural Japan for a while, teaching at elementary schools. Days were fun during class, but very quiet after. My girlfriend lived hours away. I didn't go out much. Had little money, anyway.

I wanted to get out of the countryside, and dreamed of a career as a creator. I tried to make many things but failed and failed. I could not finish anything.

I loved teaching. My students were the funnest primates. I complained in passing to a fellow about teaching the planets to a group of 7 year olds. "These little motherfuckers remember all the Pokemon, but they can't remember seven damn words.". He said, well, maybe it's because Pokemon has a story. Holy shit, that was it!

That night, my girlfriend and I cooked up a story about a spaceship traveling to the planets. Mercury was the icy rock, Venus was the hazy inferno. The kids ate that shit up.

That spring, I wrote [Tattsu](/posts/tattsu) on a school piano at Oiwake Elementary. I drew [Xeno the Alien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu3iGtqeYD4) on a 4th grade clasroom blackboard. My journal was ridden with scenes about undead bounty hunters and space assassins. Worlds were popping out left and right.

Stories have power.

## Raiders of the lost _θ_

![A torch illuminarting ancient symbols on a dungeon wall.](/assets/images/indy-torch.webp){ optimize width=700 }

The screen lights up like shining a torch to ancient hieroglyphs on a wall. They look as intractable as before, but you have no time to hesitate. The necrophagi lurk in the dark, and you can't stay for too long.

Piece by piece, I put the jigsaw together. It was heavy and it was scary. But every night, the story would continue.

Finally one day it was done. Space Invaders. I was very proud. I played that shit for ages.

When I showed it to my students, they were psyched. You made this? Felt pretty good about myself. But one little motherfucker again came to tickle the dragon.

"Why doesn't it turn?"

"What do you mean turn? It's not suppposed to turn."

"Why?"

Yeah, why?

Went back home. This kid is onto something. Let me give it a shot.

The maths seemed simple. But for the first time I would venture into the unknown. I was not following a manual.

That shit was scary. And fun.

I opened a new chamber in the dungeon, and it here's where the real treasure lurked.

Programming's a bitch. But she's wicked fun.
