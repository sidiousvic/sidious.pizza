![A spaceship](/assets/images/shot-dark.webp){ optimize width=800 }

Cicadas rang outside. The fan blew smoke of a marlboro joint into the haze of the Japanese summer. A programming manual and an empty can of Asahi sat on the desk, next to my computer. On the screen, Unity3D, and my maiden lines of _C#_.

```csharp
 float angle = Mathf.Atan2(player.y, player.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
 Quaternion theta = Quaternion.AngleAxis(angle, Vector3.forward);
```

I run the compiler. Launch the program. An ominous beat plays. The screen reads: `SPACE PHANTOM`. Hit <span class="tag border">ENTER</span>. An alien ship emerges from the dark. I hit the arrow key and play.

_\*pew pew\*,_ _\*swoosh swoosh\*..._

It's a fun, don't get me wrong. Feels like _Space Invaders_. There's just something... missing. The mechanics feel a little tight. I put the ciggy down and lay back to think.

The ship moves in the `x` direction. It shoots lasers in the `y`, where the enemies come from. To shoot them, it needs to move below them. Ah! That's what feels heavy and dank. What if you could shoot enemies without moving all that? What if you could shoot _at an angle?_

_<p class="shake">An angle.</p>_

A tinge of fear drips down my spine. There's something sinister about that thought, something smells funny.

_...something smells like `math`._

## The dark arts

![ ](/assets/images/summoning-maths.webp){ optimize width=800 }

Maths is the _`OG`_ dark arts; it doesn't deal with the object, it deals with the _shadows_ of the object.

It uses formal language to [summon spectres](), [observe obscure truths](), and augur the future.

No amount of grammar, though, will drive mathematical objects from the darkness. No amount of syntax will elliminate the shadows, and shadows are not what they seem.

It's called [abstract thought](). Some are born for it, but most of us are afraid of the dark.

## Fear of the dark

![A spaceship](/assets/images/fear-of-the-dark.webp){ optimize width=800 }

[Underrated Iron Maiden album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bePCRKGUwAY), and one of our primal instincts.

We fear the dark as a survival mechanism, evolved to avoiding potential threats that are harder to detect without light.

## In praise of shadows

> No words can describe that sensation as one sits in the dim light, basking in the faint glow reflected from the shoji. <p class="quote-author">è°·å´Žç´”ä¸€éƒŽ</p>

![ ](/assets/images/praise-shadows.webp){ optimize width=800 }

The old Japanese architects learned to live in darkness, to welcome the darkness and shadows.

Tanizaki praises dark toilets.

Maybe, jsut like pirates wore eye patches to see in the darkness, we too must learn how to live in it.

## Raiders of the lost _Î¸_

![A torch illuminarting ancient symbols on a dungeon wall.](/assets/images/indy-torch.webp){ optimize width=700 }

The screen lights up like shining a torch to ancient hieroglyphs on a wall.

I close my eyes and submerge myself.

I can see the spectres of the symbols in my inner eye. Suddenly it all makes sense.

```csharp
 float angle = Mathf.Atan2(player.y, player.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
 Quaternion theta = Quaternion.AngleAxis(angle, Vector3.forward);
```
