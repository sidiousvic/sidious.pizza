### Axioms

- Programming is a mix of maths and language.
- Maths and language deal with shadows.
- Primates have a fear of the dark.
- We can praise shadows instead of driving them away.
- I've been trying to understand the symbols in the light.
- Extinguish the torch. Observe the inner eye.
- The answer lies between the shadows and the light.

Cicadas rang outside. The fan blowed smoke of a marlboro joint into the haze of the Japanese summer. A programming manual and an empty can of Asahi sat on the desk, next to my computer. On the screen, Unity3D, and my maiden lines of _C#_.

```csharp
    float angle = Mathf.Atan2(player.y, player.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
    Quaternion theta = Quaternion.AngleAxis(angle, Vector3.forward);
```

I do the ritual. Run the compiler. Start the game. An ominous beat plays. The screen reads: `SPACE PHANTOM`. Hit <span class="tag border">ENTER</span>. An alien ship emerges from the dark. I hit the arrow key. The ship does not move.

Audio stops, and the screen freezes. F\*ck, I've broken it again.

_This programming thing's a bitch_. I haven't moved much, but I'm tired like a dog. Ran out of brain juice. _Who put you up for this shit? Yourself. You wanted to make a silly spaceship game._ I mean, I wasn't expecting cake. I think I've done plenty hard sh\*t before. But there's something _sinister_ about this...

_...It smells too much like `math`._

A Kafkian tinge of fear drips down my spine. Numbers and symbols sprawl on my computer screen, tangled like a lie. Slowly, line by line, I realize that I've been plotting a crime, each instruction deliberate, cold, wicked. Jesus Christ. Am I doing _math_? I've ensared myself in my own web. _I am not the fly. I am the spider_.

Turn off the screen. My blood is cold. I run for the door and tread outside. It's dark, damp and I'm scared, but at least I know the way to FamilyMart.

## The dark arts

Primates tend to hate math. Some are born for it, but most of us have a _fear of the dark._

Math is the _`OG`_ dark arts. It doesn't deal with the thing, it deals with the _shadows of the thing_. It describes non-physical objects, objects in the void. We ooze these objects into partial view with symbols, and organize these symbols into formal language. No amount of grammar, though, will drive them from the darkness. No amount of syntax will let us touch them, hear them, or observe them, at least not in their primal form.

<!-- <!-1- The screen lights up like shining a torch to ancient hieroglyphs on a wall. They look as intractable as before, but you have no time to hesitate. The necrophagi lurk in the dark, and you can't stay for too long. -1-> -->
