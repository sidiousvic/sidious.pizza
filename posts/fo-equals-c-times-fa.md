With the help of a Finnish friend and fellow methematician, I've derived an algebraic formula that might prove useful to those wanting to "find out".

It has been [widely established]() that the more you fuck about the more you find out.

So let `Fa` be amount you fuck about, and `Fo` how much you do find out. We thus specify a direct linear relationship between fucking about and finding out. This relationship can be represented in a simple, yet elegant equation, as follows.

```math

Fa = c(Fo)

```

Where `c` is a constant of proportionality that represents the _efficiency_ of fucking about in terms of generating _consequences_ and thus gained knowledge or things found out.

```bash

Fo (Finding Out)

+ · · · · · · · · · · · · · · > Fa (Fucking about)

```

However, it has also been found that certain inconvenient initial conditions such as being dead result in the amount of finding out (denoted as `Fo`) collapsing to `undefined`. Moreover, one may fuck about in a manner which by means of trespassing a limit may result in a state of spontaneous non-existence.

It is precise to incorporate into the formula a limit to account for a scenario where excessive fucking about (denoted as `Fmax`) represents the mildly severe yet indeterminate consequence of death.

The modified formula is as follows.

```math

K = c \cdot Fo \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\{F < F_{\text{max}}\}} + `undefined` \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\{F >= F_{\text{max}}\}}

```

<p class="shake">Where,</p>

- `c⋅Fa` is the formula for knowledge gained from fucking about.
- `1{F<Fmax}` is an indicator function that equals 1 when `Fa` is less than `Fmax` and `undefined` otherwise.
- `undefined⋅1` is an indicator function that equals `undefined` when `F` is greater than or equal to `Fmax`, effectively bringing `Fo` to a non-value in this case.

Thus when `Fa < Fmax` the amount of finding out is directly proportional to `F`. When `Fa` reaches or exceeds `Fmax` (also denoted as `SnuffedIt`)

This piecewise function demonstrates that while the fucking about generally leads to increased finding out, there is a crucial limit beyond which it becomes counterproductive to fuck about.

We end with a useful formula for finding out safely! Thanks to Ville, my dear snowman and collaborator in this finding. Stay tuned for more.
