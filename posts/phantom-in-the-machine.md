This is a work in progress. I want to write about programming, information theory and computing in the form of a series of stories.

I want to ask the question, "what is inside the computer?" and compare it to a phantom world that we can communicate with by weaving programs and algorithms.

I want to draw people into that world and realize that the boundaries that separate it from ours are getting blurrier by the day.
