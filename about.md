## Hola amig(x)s!

My name is Vic. Welcome to my cyber space. Here's where I
[spill my brains](/weblog), share [weird music](/swims), computer programs

[haiku](/kaminari-no-kage). Don't forget to visit the [sitemap](/sitemap)
begin your adventure. Here's a little bit more about me.

### BORN AND RAISED IN THE DESERT

![A mountain in a desert city.](/assets/images/chihuahua.webp){ optimize width=800 fetchpriority="low" caption="Chihuahua, Chih. Mexico" }

I was born and raised in the state of Chihuahua, in the north of Mexico. It is an arid region where water and plants are scarce. They say _Xicuahua_ means "dry and sandy place". It's the [birthplace of the burrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito#:~:text=Burritos%20are%20a%20traditional%20food%20of%20Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20a%20city%20bordering%20El%20Paso%2C%20Texas%2C%20in%20the%20northern%20Mexican%20state%20of%20Chihuahua%2C%20where%20people%20buy%20them%20at%20restaurants%20and%20roadside%20stands.%20Northern%20Mexican%20border%20towns%20like%20Villa%20Ahumada%20have%20an%20established%20reputation%20for%20serving%20burritos.), and one of the areas of [highest scorpionism on the planet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0041010194903832).

I have fond memories of playing footy on the dusty streets with neighbors and [empty Frutsi](https://cdn2.excelsior.com.mx/media/styles/image800x600/public/pictures/2019/06/26/2171032.jpg) bottles, oogling at vacant lots and graffiti on the way to school, and picking sugarcane from the dry riverside with grandpa.

![A scorpion resting on dry earth.](/assets/images/scorpionism.webp){ optimize width=800 fetchpriority="low" caption="Your deadly neighborhood arachnid" }

In the desert we're bred with a sense of scarcity and danger that makes us loud, hardy, and stubborn. These of course are all double edged swords...

### MISLED YOUTH

I was a bit of a goblin _(_<img loading="lazy" alt="A small Shiba Inu dog, looking sad, smoking a cigarette and with a bottle of Corona beer resting in front of it" src="/assets/images/goblin.webp" width=40 height=40 style="display: inline-block; margin: -0.5rem 0;" />_)_ when a young. Instead of praising math and Jesus, I was playing Zelda, browsing the web and watching MTV. My heroes were fiends like [Jamie Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=452Oxqm4E3Y) and [Angus Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCjhgiVnYDs).

</div>

I skipped school, hung out with the wrong gang, and was a generic pain in the a`$$`.

I also never did my maths homework, which I consider one of my biggest fuck-ups so far and trust me, I've fucked up _many_ times.

Even tough I behave like an adult now, I think it's important to always keep a little of dumbfuckery alive to add a spice to life. A taste for mischief and (mis)adventure helped me escape dogma and gave me courage to dive into the unknown...

### <img loading="lazy" alt="A red swoosh symbol" width=40 height=40 style="transform: translateY(10px); filter: var(--venom-filter)" src="/assets/images/swoosh.webp" /> JUST DO SH\*T

I am fond of learning because it helps me understand this wicked world a bit more.

I've been a gardener on the Japanese coast, a dishwasher in a desert town, a teacher near the hutongs and rice paddies. One day I'll be a wildlife explorer, own a small brewery or push a tamale truck in Shinjuku.

![A japanese classroom with an alien drawn on the blackboard](/assets/images/aliens-on-board.webp){ optimize priority="high" width=800 caption="Learn to teach, teach to learn" }

[I like cooking up wacky ideas](/projects). I drew [Xeno the Alien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu3iGtqeYD4) for my 4th grade classroom, turned nightmares into awkward doomer rock when making [NEMESIS](https://open.spotify.com/intl-ja/album/1qHUvcdIbPv4CTNTDWlzPU?si=LaftNGr6Ska3ZAMejh1obA), and studied the dark arts of mathematics when designing [SPACE PHANTOM](/spacephantom).

They say an idle brain is the devil's fruit shop, or something like that.

Anyway, boredom breeds misadventures. And I know a place full of those!

### TOKYO BOY

> "What a strange thing! To be alive beneath ginkgo leaves."

I love Tokyo because it's mad, not in a good of bad way, but in a **fun** way.

You can swing through its streets like a jungle, eat at a new joint every time and never run out, break no laws and still feel like a villain!

<div class="picture-grid">

![A river near Asakusabashi, in east Tokyo.](/assets/images/tokyo.gif){ optimize }
![A street with a cherry blossom tree and a convenience store in Tokyo.](/assets/images/cherry-blossoms-at-nite.gif){ optimize }

</div>

Fried chicken by the _conbini_, blossoms and booze by the river, dystopic designs and tenebrous shrines, suits and skirts and gangsters and weirdos.

![The Tokyo skyline at night.](/assets/images/skyline-tokyo.gif){ optimize }

</div>

You can say it's demented, jammed, cold, but you can't say it's boring.

I may get sick of it all someday... but I will always call it home.
