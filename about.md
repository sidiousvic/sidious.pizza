Hola amigxs, my name is Vic. Welcome to my cyber space. Here's where I [spill my brains](/weblog), share [weird music](/swims) and computer programs (like [_Phantom Pizza_](/phantompizza), the game at the home page) and even [haiku](/kaminari-no-ura). Don't forget to visit the [sitemap](/sitemap) to keep exploring. Here's a little more about me.

## BORN AND RAISED IN THE DESERT

<br>

![A mountain in a desert city.](/assets/images/chihuahua.webp){ optimize width=300 fetchpriority="low" caption="Chihuahua, Chih. Mexico" }

I was born in Chihuahua, in the north of Mexico. It's a very dry region where water and plants are scarce. It's the [birthplace of the burrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito#:~:text=Burritos%20are%20a%20traditional%20food%20of%20Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20a%20city%20bordering%20El%20Paso%2C%20Texas%2C%20in%20the%20northern%20Mexican%20state%20of%20Chihuahua%2C%20where%20people%20buy%20them%20at%20restaurants%20and%20roadside%20stands.%20Northern%20Mexican%20border%20towns%20like%20Villa%20Ahumada%20have%20an%20established%20reputation%20for%20serving%20burritos.), and one of the areas of highest scorpionism on the planet.

![A scorpion resting on dry earth.](/assets/images/scorpionism.webp){ optimize width=300 fetchpriority="low" caption="Your deadly neighborhood arachnid" }

I'm very proud to be from the Mexican north. We are a hardworking, industrious, no-bullshit kind of people. There's still a sense of dignity and politeness that you can only find in small old towns these days.

## MISLED YOUTH

I was a bit of a goblin _(<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/goblin.webp" width=40 style="display: inline-block" />)_ when young, and skipped school to play ball, guitar and skateboard. I spent a lot of time playing Zelda and watching MTV. My heroes were [Jamie Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=452Oxqm4E3Y) and Angus Young.

![A man playing wearing a schoolboy's uniform, playing guitar agitatedly](/assets/movies/angus.mp4){ optimize video caption="Because MTV brings out the bitch in you." }

Even tough I behave like an adult now, I think it's important to always keep a little of that dumbfuckery in you to add a spice to life.

## <img loading="lazy" width=40 style="transform: translateY(10px)" src="/assets/images/swoosh.webp" /> JUST DO SH\*T

I love Nike's slogan, _"Just Do Sh\*t"_. When boredom strikes I [program](https://github.com/sidiousvic), write [haiku](/kaminari-no-ura), make [doomy music](/swims) or even silly web cartoons to contribute to the net of human creation.

<a name="hello-world"></a>

## "HELLO WORLD!"

I loved the old web, where websites were simpler and wackier.

![An old-looking website, in an Internet Explorer browser from the 90's.](/assets/images/dannys-homepage.webp){ optimize caption="I hope my website makes Danny proud." }

<a name="tokyo-boy"></a>

## TOKYO BOY

Tokyo adopted me a few years ago and I love living here. You can break the law in sinless ways and still feel like a maverick.

![The author of this website ollying over an old detergent bottle on a Tokyo street.](/assets/movies/vic-skating-tokyo.mp4){ optimize video caption="This is an antisocial activity in Japan." }

Cheap booze by the convenience store, cherry blossoms in the dark, futuristic art and old ghostly shrines, the most ordinary quiet streets and bollocks weirdo shit all in the same huge slab of concrete.

I may get tired of it all someday, but I will always call it home.
