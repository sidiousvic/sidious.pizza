Hola `amigxs`, my name is Vic. Welcome to my cyber space. Here's where I
[spill my brains](/weblog), share [weird music](/swims), computer programs
(like [_Phantom Pizza_](/phantompizza), the game at the home page) and even
[haiku](/kaminari-no-ura). Don't forget to visit the [sitemap](/sitemap) to keep
exploring. Here's a little bit more about me.

## BORN AND RAISED IN THE DESERT

<br>

![A mountain in a desert city.](/assets/images/chihuahua.webp){ optimize width=800 fetchpriority="low" caption="Chihuahua, Chih. Mexico" }

I was born in Chihuahua, in the north of Mexico, an arid region where water and plants are scarce. It's the [birthplace of the burrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito#:~:text=Burritos%20are%20a%20traditional%20food%20of%20Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20a%20city%20bordering%20El%20Paso%2C%20Texas%2C%20in%20the%20northern%20Mexican%20state%20of%20Chihuahua%2C%20where%20people%20buy%20them%20at%20restaurants%20and%20roadside%20stands.%20Northern%20Mexican%20border%20towns%20like%20Villa%20Ahumada%20have%20an%20established%20reputation%20for%20serving%20burritos.), and one of the areas of highest scorpionism on the planet.

## MISLED YOUTH

I was a bit of a goblin _(_<img loading="lazy" alt="A small Shiba Inu dog, looking sad, smoking a cigarette and with a bottle of Corona beer resting in front of it" src="/assets/images/goblin.webp" width=40 height=40 style="display: inline-block; margin: -0.5rem 0;" />_)_ when young. Instead of math and Jesus, I was playing Zelda, browsing the web and watching MTV. My heroes were fiends like [Jamie Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=452Oxqm4E3Y) and [Angus Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCjhgiVnYDs).

Even tough I behave like an adult now, I think it's important to always keep a little of dumbfuckery alive to add a spice to life.

![A japanese classroom with an alien drawn on the blackboard](/assets/images/aliens-on-board.webp){ optimize priority="high" width=800 }

Dishwasher, teacher, gardener, I've done it all! Las Cruces, Hong Kong, Disneyland, I've been everywhere! Animation, music, programming, I've had too much god damn free time!

No matter where I am or how I'm earning bread, I'm always cooking up some wacky sh\*t on the side. [Xeno the Alien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu3iGtqeYD4) was a doodle on a my 4th grade classroom blackboard. [Tattsu](/posts/tattsu) was a . on. [NEMESIS](https://open.spotify.com/intl-ja/album/1qHUvcdIbPv4CTNTDWlzPU?si=LaftNGr6Ska3ZAMejh1obA) was an, and [SPACE PHANTOM](/posts/shot-in-the-dark) when .

They say an idle brain is the devil's fruit shop, or something like that. Anyway, _boredom breeds misadventure._

## TOKYO BOY

Loitering by the convenience store, [ginkgo leaves in the dark](/posts/icchou-ga-ochiru), cyberpunk malls and tenebrous shrines, suits and artists and weirdos. I may get tired of it all someday, but I will always call it home.
