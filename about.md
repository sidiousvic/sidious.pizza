Hola amigxs, my name is Vic. Welcome to my cyber space. Here's where I
[spill my brains](/weblog), share [weird music](/swims) and computer programs
(like [_Phantom Pizza_](/phantompizza), the game at the home page) and even
[haiku](/kaminari-no-ura). Don't forget to visit the [sitemap](/sitemap) to keep
exploring. Here's a little more about me.

## BORN AND RAISED IN THE DESERT

<br>

![A mountain in a desert city.](/assets/images/chihuahua.webp){ optimize width=800 fetchpriority="low" caption="Chihuahua, Chih. Mexico" }

I was born in Chihuahua, in the north of Mexico. It's a very dry region where
water and plants are scarce. It's the
[birthplace of the burrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito#:~:text=Burritos%20are%20a%20traditional%20food%20of%20Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20a%20city%20bordering%20El%20Paso%2C%20Texas%2C%20in%20the%20northern%20Mexican%20state%20of%20Chihuahua%2C%20where%20people%20buy%20them%20at%20restaurants%20and%20roadside%20stands.%20Northern%20Mexican%20border%20towns%20like%20Villa%20Ahumada%20have%20an%20established%20reputation%20for%20serving%20burritos.),
and one of the areas of highest scorpionism on the planet.

I'm very proud to be from the Mexican north. We are a hardworking, industrious,
no-bullshit kind of people. There's still a sense of dignity and politeness that
you can only find in small old towns these days.

## MISLED YOUTH

I was a bit of a goblin
_(<img loading="lazy" alt="A small Shiba Inu dog, looking sad, smoking a cigarette and with a bottle of Corona beer resting in front of it" src="/assets/images/goblin.webp" width=40 height=40 style="display: inline-block; margin: -0.5rem 0;" />)_
when young, and skipped school to play ball, guitar and skateboard. I spent a
lot of time playing Zelda and watching MTV. My heroes were
[Jamie Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=452Oxqm4E3Y) and Angus Young.

![A man playing wearing a schoolboy's uniform, playing guitar agitatedly](/assets/images/angus.webp){ optimize width=700 caption="Because MTV brings out the bitch in you." }

Even tough I behave like an adult now, I think it's important to always keep a
little of that dumbfuckery inside to add a spice to life.

![A japanese classroom with an alien drawn on the blackboard](/assets/images/aliens-on-board.webp){ optimize priority="high" width=800 }

I lived in rural Japan for a while, teaching at elementary schools. Days were fun during the daytime, but very quiet after. I didn't go out much. My girlfriend lived hours away. I had little money. I spent a lot of time alone, twiddling my thumbs, and other things, at home, bored out of my brain.

They say an idle brain is the devil's fruit shop, or something like that. Anyway, boredom breeds misadventure.

I wrote [Tattsu](/posts/tattsu) on a school piano at Oiwake Elementary. I drew [Xeno the Alien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu3iGtqeYD4) on a 4th grade clasroom blackboard. My journal was ridden with scenes about undead bounty hunters and space assassins. I released NEMESIS, and [I began to program](/posts/shot-in-the-dark).

## TOKYO BOY

Tokyo adopted me a few years ago and I am very happy here. You can break the law
in sinless ways and still feel like a maverick.

Cheap booze by the convenience store, cherry blossoms in the dark, futuristic
art and old ghostly shrines, the most ordinary quiet streets and bollocks weirdo
shit all in the same huge slab of concrete.

I may get tired of it all someday, but I will always call it home.

## \*BEEP BOOP\*

I work in the digitization of the energy grid, or making it go _\*BEEP BOOP BOOP\*_. We install physical devices in generation plants, measure electricity _I/O_ and optimize usage.

I enjoy programming for [critical energy infra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure). We wrangle fun problems that reduce energy waste.
