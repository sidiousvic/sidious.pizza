Hola amigxs, my name is Vic. Welcome to my cyber space. Here I will [spill my brains](/weblog), share [weird music](/music) and computer programs (like [_Phantom Pizza_](/), the game at the home page). Here's a little more about me.

I was born in the state of Chihuahua, in the north of Mexico. It's a very dry region where water and plants are scarce. It's the [birthplace of the burrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito#:~:text=Burritos%20are%20a%20traditional%20food%20of%20Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20a%20city%20bordering%20El%20Paso%2C%20Texas%2C%20in%20the%20northern%20Mexican%20state%20of%20Chihuahua%2C%20where%20people%20buy%20them%20at%20restaurants%20and%20roadside%20stands.%20Northern%20Mexican%20border%20towns%20like%20Villa%20Ahumada%20have%20an%20established%20reputation%20for%20serving%20burritos.), and one of the areas of highest scorpionism on the planet.

# Misled youth

I was a bit of a goblin _(<img src="/@/goblin.png" width=40 style="display: inline-block" />)_ when young, and skipped school to play ball, guitar and skateboard. I spent a lot of time playing Zelda and watching MTV. My heroes were [Jamie Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=452Oxqm4E3Y) and Angus Young.

# <img width=40 style="transform: translateY(10px)" src="/@/swoosh.png" /> JUST DO SH\*T

When boredom strikes I bike, wrote [haiku](/tags/haiku), made [doomer music](https://open.spotify.com/intl-ja/track/4YinnI3uql8ax8EZyqyIjl?si=c25ebef66fa546bc) and even made silly web cartoons to pass the time.

Programming is how I earn my sushi today. I work for a company that is driving the digitization of the electric grid in Japan, making energy use more green.
