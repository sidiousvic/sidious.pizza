Hola `amigxs`, my name is Vic. Welcome to my cyber space. Here's where I
[spill my brains](/weblog), share [weird music](/swims), computer programs
(like [_Phantom Pizza_](/phantompizza), the game at the home page) and even
[haiku](/kaminari-no-ura). Don't forget to visit the [sitemap](/sitemap) to keep
exploring. Here's a little bit more about me.

## BORN AND RAISED IN THE DESERT

<br>

![A mountain in a desert city.](/assets/images/chihuahua.webp){ optimize width=800 fetchpriority="low" caption="Chihuahua, Chih. Mexico" }

I was born and raised in Chihuahua, in the north of Mexico, an arid region where water and plants are scarce. It's the [birthplace of the burrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito#:~:text=Burritos%20are%20a%20traditional%20food%20of%20Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20a%20city%20bordering%20El%20Paso%2C%20Texas%2C%20in%20the%20northern%20Mexican%20state%20of%20Chihuahua%2C%20where%20people%20buy%20them%20at%20restaurants%20and%20roadside%20stands.%20Northern%20Mexican%20border%20towns%20like%20Villa%20Ahumada%20have%20an%20established%20reputation%20for%20serving%20burritos.), and one of the areas of [highest scorpionism on the planet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0041010194903832).

![A scorpion resting on dry earth.](/assets/images/scorpionism.webp){ optimize width=800 fetchpriority="low" caption="Your deadly neighborhood arachnid" }

In the desert we're bred with a sense of scarcity and danger that makes us hardy, and stubborn. These of course are all double edged swords...

## MISLED YOUTH

I was a bit of a goblin _(_<img loading="lazy" alt="A small Shiba Inu dog, looking sad, smoking a cigarette and with a bottle of Corona beer resting in front of it" src="/assets/images/goblin.webp" width=40 height=40 style="display: inline-block; margin: -0.5rem 0;" />_)_ when young. Instead of math and Jesus, I was playing Zelda, browsing the web and watching MTV. My heroes were fiends like [Jamie Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=452Oxqm4E3Y) and [Angus Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCjhgiVnYDs).

![ ](/assets/images/mp3-bounty.webp){ optimize width=600 }

</div>

This sense of mischief helped me escape dogma and gave me courage to dive into the unknown, but it was a real pain in the ass to many around me. I'm sorry mama.

Even tough I behave like an adult now, I think it's important to always keep a little of dumbfuckery alive to add a spice to life.

I thank every experience, every pain and pleasure, because it helps me understand this wicked world a little more. I've been a gardener on the coast, a dishwasher in the desert, a teacher near the _hutongs_. One day I'll be a wildlife explorer, own a small brewery or push a tamales truck.

No matter where I tread or what I'm doing, [I'll be cooking up some wacky thing on the side](/projects). I drew [Xeno the Alien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu3iGtqeYD4) on a 4th grade classroom blackboard, wrote [Tattsu](/posts/tattsu) on a small `KORG` synth after humming it while dishwashing. Turned night terrors into awkward doomer rock with [NEMESIS](https://open.spotify.com/intl-ja/album/1qHUvcdIbPv4CTNTDWlzPU?si=LaftNGr6Ska3ZAMejh1obA), and [studied the dark arts of maths](/posts/shot-in-the-dark) making [SPACE PHANTOM](/spacephantom).

They say an idle brain is the devil's fruit shop, or something like that. Anyway, boredom breeds misadventures. And I know a place full of them...

## TOKYO BOY

> "What a strange thing! To be alive beneath ginkgo leaves."

I love Tokyo because it's mad, not in a good of bad way, but in a _fun_ way. Tread through its streets like a jungle. Eat at a new joint every time and never run out. Break no laws and still feel like a maverick.

</div>

Fried chicken by the _conbini_, cherry blossoms and beer by the river, dystopic designs and tenebrous shrines, suits and skirts and gangsters and weirdos.

I may get sick of it all someday, but I will always call it home.
