## Overview

_Vicus Sidious pizzivorus_ is a species of primate endemic to northen Mexico. Distinguished by its mostly dark cladding, Latin beard and mustache, and a sharp-shaved skull, the outline shows a strong Persian profile, with a pronounced nose and eyebrows that sit in a perpetual state of suspiciousness, an expression shaped less by true wariness and more by the hard sunlight of its native arid origins.

Originates in [Chihuahua](https://www.google.com/search?q=chihuahua%2C+mexico&oq=chihuahua%2C+mexico&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQLhiABDIHCAIQABiABDIMCAMQABgUGIcCGIAEMgcIBBAAGIAEMgwIBRAAGBQYhwIYgAQyBwgGEAAYgAQyBwgHEAAYgAQyBwgIEAAYgATSAQgxODQzajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), a dry, arid region in northern Mexico, though some sights have been recorded as far as the Sierra Madre. Periodic waves of regional drug violence have largely pushed the organism into alternate habitats, including Hong Kong, the southwestern United States, and Japan, where it is most commonly found.

In Tokyo, the species is observed rambling streets at steady pace, sliding into indie brew joints for coffee or beer and local sentōs for rest. Despite its street adaptation, the organism retains a clear preference for mountainous habitats, forest air, and terrain that resembles its dry origin.

## Social Structure and Behavior

The default aspect is a mischievous smirk paired with scheming eyes reminiscent of a hungry, overconfident coyote (Chuck Jones variety), giving the impression that the organism has either just committed, is committing, or is moments away from committing mild mischief, frequently unaware that the process is already underway and largely targeting itself.

When mildly entertained, the organism produces a brief “uhuhuhu”. During encounters with ranchera music, banda, or pieces by Juan Gabriel, _S. pizzivorus_ exhibits a sudden spasm into extended screeching, reminiscent of a midsized desert mammal attempting a note far outside its natural range. This behavior appears reflexive and does not require social permission or audience participation. Observers are left unsure whether to applaud, retreat, or pretend nothing happened.

Although generally even-tempered, the organism displays bursts of situational aggression in ball-game play, or during brain-downgrading rituals such as skateboarding or boxing. Hunger can produce a similar rise in hostility, though the organism regulates this response through an internal pressure-release mechanism involving short bouts of mild nihilism and ambitions of world domination. However, the species is generally gentle to its group. It is generally dangerous only to itself.

Although _pizzivorus_ often retreats into solitary intervals to study, refresh, or develop new cognitive structures, it enjoys its few relationships and shows a clear preference for spending valuable time with a small number of familiar primates. These interactions are steady, forming long-term bonds that the organism maintains with loyalty.

In broader social contexts, S. pizzivorus also displays a strong enjoyment of shared activities such as long-range driving, exploring the outdoors, surfing, sauna and sentō, watching or playing football, and drinking with other primates. These behaviors strengthen group cohesion and appear to satisfy deep ancestral instincts.

Outside group settings, the species engages in consistent weight training, late-night reading of historical material, and nocturnal mathematics study sessions. S. pizzivorus is capable of migrating long distances within a single day, maintaining steady pace and mild agitation until it reaches a temporary den.

## Diet

_S. pizzivorus_ is omnivorous, yet a voracious meat eater of beef in nearly all forms, from raw to barbecued. When migrating back toward its desert abodes, the species is known to inhale tacos at speeds that make accurate field measurement difficult.

In everyday environments, the species shows consistent attraction to craft brews, especially acid-forward coffees and malty, darker, or hazy beers. It routinely forages for sushi, hamburgers, and other calorie-dense goblin meals.

When exposed to televised baseball or football inside Shōwa-era establishments, pizzivorus tends to prolong its feeding window, consuming small plates over long intervals while maintaining fixed visual attention on the game. When nihonshu is present, this behavior becomes even more pronounced, producing slower sipping patterns, reduced migratory impulses, and a steady rise in passive caloric intake.

Pizza holds a unique ecological role in the species’ life cycle and is the basis for the epithet pizzivorus. Its consumption, typically in small groups of known primates, produces steady mood and reduced migratory restlessness.

Field observations suggest that the organism regards pizza as more than physical nourishment, displaying reverence for its stable mathematical ratios, and the cheese, bread, pepperoni "holy trinity". The act of sharing pizza appears equally primal, functioning as a community-stabilizing ritual that reinforces its social bonds within the familiar group. Regular exposure contributes to overall behavioral regulation, both nutritional and spiritual.
