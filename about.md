My name is Victor René Molina Rodríguez. I was born in 1991 in northern Mexico. I live in Tokyo, where I work as an engineer for Toyota. 

## Early Life

I was born the town of Santa Isabel, Chihuahua, Mexico. My father sold electric mining cable and mother taught at a public primary school. I have one younger brother. I grew up with 90's cartoons, Nintendo, and the internet. I've loved football and music all my life. I studied university in Las Cruces, USA, spent some time in Hong Kong and Mexico again before moving to Japan.

## Work
I've done many jobs in my life. I've been a gardener, teacher, and designer, and now I am an engineering lead wrangling a great team that builds energy systems software.


## More likes
Music, football, beer, skateboarding, math, programming, coffee, graphics, reading, sentō, boxing, engines, weightlifting, horse riding, pizza.

## Principles
I am interested observing the true nature of things and responding accordingly. I think there is no thing such as inaction. I do not think suffering and temptation are enemies, they are only movements in nature that we must pass through. 

# Influences
Kurosawa, Giger, Hemingway, Paz, Hofstader, Roosevelt, Tanizaki, Kar-Wai, Bergman, Toriyama, Chuck Jones, Richard Feynman, Sergio Leone, Grace Hopper, Prigogine.
