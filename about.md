## Early Life

My name is Vic.  _Victor Rene Molina Rodriguez_, in the town of Santa Isabel, Chihuahua, in northern Mexico. I grew up in a working-class family, my father sold electric mining cable and mother taught at a public primary school. I have one younger brother who I love a lot. My mother used to say "we are rich in love." and "you need to live amongst wolves". My father used to say "get your shit off the entrance".

## Work

Engineer at Toyota in Tokyo, where he leads a small group of fellow primates building software for electric systems.
