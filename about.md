Hola amigxs, my name is Vic. Welcome to my cyber space. Here's where I [spill my brains](/weblog), share [weird music](/swims) and computer programs (like [_Phantom Pizza_](/phantompizza), the game at the home page) and even [haiku](/kaminari-no-ura). Don't forget to visit the [sitemap](/sitemap) to keep exploring. Here's a little more about me.

I was born in Chihuahua, in the north of Mexico. It's a very dry region where water and plants are scarce. It's the [birthplace of the burrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito#:~:text=Burritos%20are%20a%20traditional%20food%20of%20Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20a%20city%20bordering%20El%20Paso%2C%20Texas%2C%20in%20the%20northern%20Mexican%20state%20of%20Chihuahua%2C%20where%20people%20buy%20them%20at%20restaurants%20and%20roadside%20stands.%20Northern%20Mexican%20border%20towns%20like%20Villa%20Ahumada%20have%20an%20established%20reputation%20for%20serving%20burritos.), and one of the areas of highest scorpionism on the planet.

I'm very proud to be from the Mexican north, where people

## MISLED YOUTH

I was a bit of a goblin _(<img loading="lazy" src="/@/images/goblin.webp" width=40 style="display: inline-block" />)_ when young, and skipped school to play ball, guitar and skateboard. I spent a lot of time playing Zelda and watching MTV. My heroes were [Jamie Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=452Oxqm4E3Y) and Angus Young.

Even tough I behave like an adult now, I think it's important to always keep a little of that dumbfuckery in you to add a spice to life.

## <img loading="lazy" width=40 style="transform: translateY(10px)" src="/@/images/swoosh.webp" /> JUST DO SH\*T

I love Nike's slogan, _"Just Do Sh\*t"_. When boredom strikes I [program](https://github.com/sidiousvic), write [haiku](/kaminari-no-ura), make [doomy music](/swims) or even silly web cartoons to contribute to the net of human creation.

## "HELLO WORLD!"

I loved the old web, where websites were simpler and wackier.

## TOKYO BOY

Tokyo adopted me a few years ago and I love living here. You can break the law in sinless ways and still feel like a maverick.

Cheap booze by the convenience store, cherry blossoms in the dark, futuristic art and old ghostly shrines, the most ordinary quiet streets and bollocks weirdo shit all in the same huge slab of concrete.

I may get tired of it all someday, but I will always call it home.
