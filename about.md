# About

I am Vic. I am 34. I am from northern Mexico. I've lived in the USA, and now in Tokyo, Japan.

I enjoy music, walking, writing, boxing, drawing and animating, driving, studying, football (_Hala Madrid!_) the outdoors, and drinking.

I respect tenacity, generosity, stableness, temperance, and humor. I find my friends tend to have these qualities in good measure. 

I like shadows, and the occult intrigues me.

I work as an engineer for Toyota. 

I appreciate math, engines and bridges, and guitars and coffee and craft beer, especially hazies and maltier brews. 

I read many books, watch fewer films, and wipe-out in music every day. 

I miss the Looney Tunes and Dragon Ball.

I love the mountains of the desert and my family and I wish them well.
