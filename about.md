I work for `TOYOTA` as a system engineer focused on electric grid 2.0 infrastructure, using algorithms to analyse consumption data, and optimize and control energy use for domestic (EV, batteries) and industrial assets (power plants, generators). 

## cat values.md

Be generous. Praise shadows. Reward good, honest work. Demand excellence. Do things right. Don't be nice, be kind. Relationships are the most important thing. `$$$` is important, but does not give life its meaning. Do what you said you would do when you were drunk. Ask everyone what their favorite flower is. ⚘ Everything is simpler than you think. Choose carefully what fucks to give. Enjoy a good beverage with other primates and do it often.
