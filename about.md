Hola `amigxs`, my name is Vic. Welcome to my cyber space. Here's where I
[spill my brains](/weblog), share [weird music](/swims) and computer programs
(like [_Phantom Pizza_](/phantompizza), the game at the home page) and even
[haiku](/kaminari-no-ura). Don't forget to visit the [sitemap](/sitemap) to keep
exploring. Here's a little bit about me.

## BORN AND RAISED IN THE DESERT

<br>

![A mountain in a desert city.](/assets/images/chihuahua.webp){ optimize width=800 fetchpriority="low" caption="Chihuahua, Chih. Mexico" }

I was born in Chihuahua, in the north of Mexico, a region where
water and plants are scarce. It's the
[birthplace of the burrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito#:~:text=Burritos%20are%20a%20traditional%20food%20of%20Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20a%20city%20bordering%20El%20Paso%2C%20Texas%2C%20in%20the%20northern%20Mexican%20state%20of%20Chihuahua%2C%20where%20people%20buy%20them%20at%20restaurants%20and%20roadside%20stands.%20Northern%20Mexican%20border%20towns%20like%20Villa%20Ahumada%20have%20an%20established%20reputation%20for%20serving%20burritos.),
and one of the areas of highest scorpionism on the planet.

In the desert we are a hardworking, industrious, no-bullshit kind of people. We have a sense of dignity and honesty that you can only find in small old towns. Except if you're me when I was a teenager.

## MISLED YOUTH

I was a bit of a goblin
_(<img loading="lazy" alt="A small Shiba Inu dog, looking sad, smoking a cigarette and with a bottle of Corona beer resting in front of it" src="/assets/images/goblin.webp" width=40 height=40 style="display: inline-block; margin: -0.5rem 0;" />)_
when young, and abandoned my responsibilities to play ball, guitar and skateboard. Instead of doing maths, or going to church, I spent a
lot of time playing Zelda and watching MTV. My heroes were
[Jamie Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=452Oxqm4E3Y) and Angus Young.

[I was made publicly available a month after the internet](https://www.google.com/search?q=when+was+the+internet+publicly+available), and I used it to explore beyond the desert. My email was `burn_the_chairs@hotmail.com`. I was an admin of a Dragon Ball board, and the resident `.mp3` bounty hunter.

I'm not proud of all the things I did back then, but even tough I behave like an adult now, I think it's important to always keep a little of that dumbfuckery alive to add a spice to life.

I've been a dishwasher. I also worked at a video store. I lived in rural Japan for a while, teaching at elementary schools.

They say an idle brain is the devil's fruit shop, or something like that. Anyway, boredom breeds misadventure.

I wrote [Tattsu](/posts/tattsu) on a piano at Oiwake Elementary. I drew [Xeno the Alien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu3iGtqeYD4) on a 4th grade clasroom blackboard. My journal was ridden with scenes about undead fiends and space assassins. I released [NEMESIS](https://open.spotify.com/intl-ja/album/1qHUvcdIbPv4CTNTDWlzPU?si=LaftNGr6Ska3ZAMejh1obA), and [I programmed my first game](/posts/shot-in-the-dark).

## TOKYO BOY

Tokyo adopted me a few years ago and I am very happy here. You can break the law
in sinless ways and still feel like a maverick.

Cheap booze by the convenience store, cherry blossoms in the dark, futuristic
art and old ghostly shrines, the most ordinary quiet streets and bollocks weirdo
shit all in the same huge slab of concrete.

I may get tired of it all someday, but I will always call it home.

I work in the digitization of the energy grid, or making it go _\*BEEP BOOP BOOP\*_. We install physical devices in generation plants, measure electricity _I/O_ and optimize usage.

I enjoy programming for [critical energy infra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure). We wrangle fun problems that reduce energy waste.
