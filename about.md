Hola amigxs, my name is Vic and this my cyber space. I will be [writing](/weblog) and sharing my music and computer programs here.

# Born and raised in the desert

I was born in the state of Chihuahua, in the north of Mexico. It's a very dry region where water and plants are scarce. It's the [birthplace of the burrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito#:~:text=Burritos%20are%20a%20traditional%20food%20of%20Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20a%20city%20bordering%20El%20Paso%2C%20Texas%2C%20in%20the%20northern%20Mexican%20state%20of%20Chihuahua%2C%20where%20people%20buy%20them%20at%20restaurants%20and%20roadside%20stands.%20Northern%20Mexican%20border%20towns%20like%20Villa%20Ahumada%20have%20an%20established%20reputation%20for%20serving%20burritos.), and one of the areas of highest scorpionism on the planet.

# Misled youth

I was a bit of a goblin when young, and used to skip school to play ball and skateboard. I spent a lot of time listening to hard rock records. My heroes became [Jamie Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=452Oxqm4E3Y) and Jimi Hendrix.

I remember listening to [Foxey Lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PVjcIO4MT4) on my discman while taking out the trash. I broke my arm crashing into a parked car trying to do a _"hardflip"_.

I was a seasoned [bounty hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_piracy) of _.mp3s_ which I shared with family and friends. I spent a lot of my teenage years surfing the web, playing Zelda and watching MTV.

# Skating away

I left home at 17 with my guitar _"Wozza"_ and a few books. Years followed in southwestern USA, Osaka, and Hong Kong, tumbling back to Mexico from time to time, but [never staying there too long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Mexican_drug_war). I went back to Japan and never left.

When boredom struck I biked, read a shit ton of books, wrote [haiku](/tags/haiku), made [doomer music](https://open.spotify.com/intl-ja/track/4YinnI3uql8ax8EZyqyIjl?si=c25ebef66fa546bc) and even made silly web cartoons to pass the time.

I had these misadventures under the pseudonym _"Vic Sidious"_ a play on [Sid Vicious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDyb_alTkMQ). I'm fascinated by villains and anarchists like Sid. For a while I felt like one, but it was too easy to confuse half-assing everything with being a rebel. After 25 I was ready to whole-ass something.

# Tokyo boy

One summer I studied how to program a low resolution game using C#, which ended up becoming _"Phantom Pizza"_, the game on [the homepage](/). It was fun like hell. I was saving up to buy a motorcycle at the time, but I used the money to continue mashing keys and move to Tokyo to find work with computers.

Programming is how I earn my sushi today. I work for a company that is driving the digitization of the electric grid in Japan, making energy use more green.

I still play guitar and skate sometime. I'm saving up for a motorcycle again. I dedicate some time to my craft, such this website, but I really spend most of the time drinking and laughing with friends.

Thank you for reading. _„Å©„ÅÜ„ÇÇ„Å©„ÅÜ„ÇÇÔºÅ_ I'll see you around [sidious.pizza](/). Welcome and I hope you have a great time here.
